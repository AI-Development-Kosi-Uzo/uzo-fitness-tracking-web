Contracts in code (frozen once Core PR merges):

Branching
- migration/core
- migration/logging
- migration/library
- migration/history
- migration/progress
- migration/settings
- migration/pwa-infra
- migration/testing-ci

Rules
- Do not change pinned contracts/specs. Propose changes via a tiny PR from `migration/core` only.
- Ship in small PRs. Each PR must include unit tests; if a route renders, include a minimal e2e smoke.
- Own only your epic paths. Do not modify othersâ€™ folders.
- Reference repository interfaces; do not change schema.
 - Always rebase feature branches onto `origin/main` before opening a PR and again after the PR is merged.
 - Merge strategy: use GitHub "Squash and merge" for all PRs (linear history; no merge commits).

Feature branch convention (keep worktrees persistent)
- Keep one persistent worktree per epic pointing to `migration/<epic>`.
- For each task/PR, create a short-lived branch inside that worktree off `origin/main` named:
  - `migration/<epic>-NN-<short-dashed-summary>` (NN is zero-padded sequence like 01, 02, ...)
- Example helper (run inside the epic worktree):
```bash
EPIC=logging
TASK_NUM=01
SUMMARY="Start session route stubs"
BRANCH="migration/${EPIC}-$(printf '%02d' "$TASK_NUM")-$(echo "$SUMMARY" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-' | sed 's/^-\\|-$$//g' | sed 's/--\+/-/g')"
git fetch origin --prune
git switch -c "$BRANCH" origin/main
```
- Target PRs to `main`. After merge, switch back to `migration/<epic>` in the worktree and delete the feature branch.
