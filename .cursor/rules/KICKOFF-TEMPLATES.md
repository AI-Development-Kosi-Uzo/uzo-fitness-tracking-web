# Kickoff Templates

Use the ready-to-paste templates in:
- `React-Migration/Runbooks/Runbook-Cursor-Human.md` → “Ready-to-paste templates for remaining parallel work”

Templates included for:
- Logging, Library, History, Progress, PWA/Infra, Data-Sync, Testing/CI, Deploy

Always include in your kickoff:
- Branch name, owned paths, exact tasks copied from `React-Migration/16-Tasks.md`, rules (no contract edits, use repos only), PR gates, and first PR boundary.
